>[!note] Purpose of this note
>To gain a deep understanding of the normal distribution. This combines notes from MATH447 and Grant Sanderson's "Why Ï€ is in the normal distribution (beyond integral tricks)"

Typically, a random variable $Y$ has a **normal probability distribution** if its probability density function (PDF) is

f_{Y}(y)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{ 2\pi }}e^{-(y-\mu)^{2}/(2\sigma^{2})}

As Grant states it,
